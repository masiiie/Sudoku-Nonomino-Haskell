# Sudoku-Nonomino-Haskell

It is a tool implemented in Haskell to simulate the **Nonomino Sudoku** game.

The necessary types are defined to express the logic of the game, as well as the implementation of the routines that, given an input of 9 *nonominos*, verify that a solution exists and grant it if it exists.

To better understand the logic of the game and the orientation of the project see [](/Proyecto de Haskell/Orientaci√≥n de Proyecto de Haskell.pdf)

# Implementation explained

The types `Casilla`, `Nonomino` and `Sudoku` are defined where:
* A **Casilla** is represented by its position *(Int, Int)* in the sudoku puzzle and its value 1-9, 0 if it is empty.
* A **Nonomino** is a list of *Casilla*.
* A **Sudoku** can be a `Not_solution` or, a set of `Nonomino` together with a list of tuples, named `to_solve` , with the possible values that the empty squares of the board can take.



```haskell
data Casilla = Casilla { pos::(Int,Int), val::Int } deriving Eq
data Nonomino = Nonomino { elements::[Casilla] } deriving Eq
data Sudoku = Sudoku { nonominos::[Nonomino], to_solve::[((Int,Int),[Int])]} | Not_solution deriving Eq
```


The input is an array of integers *a*<sub>9\*i+j</sub> where the position *(9\*i+j)* represents the position *(i, j)* of the final sudoku puzzle. The number of the tens of *a*<sub>9\*i+j</sub> represents the nonomino to which it belongs and the units, the value of that position initially (if it is 0, it means that the box is empty).
