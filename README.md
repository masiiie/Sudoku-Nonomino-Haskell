# Sudoku-Nonomino-Haskell

It is a tool implemented in Haskell to simulate the **Nonomino Sudoku** game.

The necessary types are defined to express the logic of the game, as well as the implementation of the routines that, given an input of 9 *nonominos*, verify that a solution exists and grant it if it exists.
